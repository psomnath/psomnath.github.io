# About Me

I’m Somnath Purkayastha — a technical program leader with a career spent building large‑scale cloud, data, and compliance systems for government and enterprise environments. I specialize in turning complex, high‑stakes engineering challenges into clear plans, scalable architectures, and reliable execution across distributed teams.

My work sits at the intersection of cloud infrastructure, security and compliance, data platforms, and modern AI/ML. I enjoy solving problems that require both deep technical understanding and cross‑organizational leadership — the kind of challenges where clarity, rigor, and long‑term thinking matter.

## What I Do
For more than a decade at Microsoft, I’ve led programs that support U.S. Government customers and sovereign cloud environments. My work has included:

- Defining architecture and multi‑year delivery plans for Azure Sovereign Cloud  
- Establishing foundational engineering and compliance requirements for next‑generation sovereign offerings  
- Leading teams that build and operate Liquid, Microsoft’s compliance evidence and readiness platform  
- Creating scorecard systems used by senior leadership to track operational health and engineering KPIs  
- Driving supportability architecture for large‑scale data systems like Parallel Data Warehouse  
- Building communities of practice that improve execution consistency across 100+ PMs  

Before Microsoft, I spent a decade at Deloitte delivering statewide systems, improving mission‑critical performance by orders of magnitude, and leading modernization programs for global enterprises. Earlier in my career, I designed large‑scale billing and scheduling systems for industrial and telecom environments.

Across all of these roles, I’ve been drawn to problems that require both technical depth and organizational alignment — places where architecture, execution, and leadership converge.

## How I Work
I bring a structured, scenario‑driven approach to every program I lead. My strengths include:

- Translating ambiguous requirements into clear technical direction  
- Designing systems that scale across engineering, security, and compliance boundaries  
- Building alignment among senior leaders and distributed teams  
- Driving execution across multi‑year, multi‑team initiatives  
- Communicating complex ideas with clarity and precision  

I’m known for analytical rigor, calm leadership, and the ability to bring order to complexity — especially in environments where reliability, compliance, and trust are non‑negotiable.

## What I’m Learning
I’m currently expanding my technical depth through graduate AI/ML studies at Johns Hopkins and Stanford. My academic work complements my industry experience and keeps me grounded in the latest thinking across:

- Machine learning foundations  
- Applied AI systems  
- Data science and analytics  
- Modern cloud architectures  

I enjoy applying these concepts to real‑world problems, both at work and through personal projects.

## Outside of Work
I’m a family‑focused cyclist who enjoys organizing group rides, optimizing gear setups, and creating safe, comfortable experiences for everyone involved. I bring the same mindset to my personal life that I bring to my technical work — thoughtful planning, continuous improvement, and a deep commitment to helping others succeed.
