# Welcome to My Blog

I’ve been meaning to create a space where I can share ideas, experiments, and reflections from my work across cloud architecture, data platforms, AI/ML, and program leadership. Now that my GitHub Pages site is up and running, this feels like the right place to start.

## Why I’m Starting This Blog
Over the years, I’ve found that writing helps me clarify my thinking. Whether I’m exploring a new ML concept, breaking down a complex system design, or reflecting on lessons from leading large-scale engineering programs, writing forces me to slow down and articulate ideas with precision.

This blog will be a place to capture:
- Technical notes and learnings  
- Architecture patterns and decision frameworks  
- AI/ML experiments and insights  
- Reflections on leadership and execution  
- Occasional personal projects or observations  

## What’s Next
I’ll start by writing short, focused posts — the kind that capture a single idea or learning. Over time, I may expand into deeper dives or multi-part series.

If you’re reading this, thanks for stopping by. I’m looking forward to building this space one post at a time.
